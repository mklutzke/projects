# Projects
This is a repository for some of the projects I've worked on, so I can gather things in one place and show them to others.

### Author collaboration networks on arXiv
Social network analysis in R using data from the preprint server arXiv. 

Final project for COGS-Q370: Experiments & Models in Cognition. Files are in the folder "q370", including slides from a presentation and an R script for the analysis.

### Instructional staff salaries at US academic institutions
Exploring how gender and academic rank relate to the salary amounts for instructional staff. 

Final project for STAT-S470: Exploratory Data Analysis. Files are in the folder "s470", including the full report in both html and pdf format, and the original R markdown file it was knitted from.

### Sectoring Contributions to Open Source Software (OSS) on GitHub
Categorizing data scraped from GitHub to identify which users belong to which economic sectors (business, academic, government, nonprofit, & household).

One of the two projects I worked on over the summer of 2020 as part of the Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars Program.
