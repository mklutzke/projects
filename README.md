# Projects
This is a repository for some of the projects I've worked on, so I can gather things in one place and show them to others. In reverse chronological order.

## Explainable AI and Conceptualizations of "Explainability"
Abstract: "Explainable AI (XAI) is a subfield of AI research that seeks to close, or at least narrow, the widening gap between the predictive power of our models and how well we understand them. Around the beginning of the 21st century, the importance of interpretability was downplayed and the field neglected. But as models are increasingly applied in high-stakes decision domains like medicine or criminal justice, the demand for explainability has risen dramatically. In this work I provide an overview of the current state of XAI research, with a focus on the importance of understanding. I also identify what I believe to be XAIâ€™s greatest weakness: a lack of cohesion. I discuss how the multifarious notions of what it means for a model to be 'explainable' lead to inconsistencies in the research, and conclude by proposing a potential solution."

Honors thesis for my B.S. in Cognitive Science. The file "xai_thesis.pdf" is the final draft.
